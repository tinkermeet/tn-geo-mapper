This tool allows you to drill down districts to individual Panchayats and recombine them to create new polygons indicating new larger regions.

- Select a district from the dropdown menu. Then select a block from the blocks dropdown menu and choose one or more panchayats.
- The chosen panchayats will be plotted on the map.
- On clicking "Combine", the selected panchayats will be combined to make a new larger region.
- The combined layers will be copied to clipboard.
- The combination can be verified by pasting in to http://geojson.io/ where it will be highlighted as one unit.
- The state of the map and the selections can be reset using "Reset Map".
